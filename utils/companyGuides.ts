## Coding Interviews
Assessed in 4 areas:
1.  **Problem Solving**: Ask clarification questions. Present multiple solutions. Don't jump to coding immediately.
2.  **Coding**: Clean, readable, optimized code.
3.  **Verification**: Proactive verification (dry run). Check edge cases.
4.  **Communication**: Talk while you code. Explain decisions.

## Machine Learning (ML) System Design Interview
45-minutes. Focuses on ability to build ML systems at scale.
Assessments:
*   **Problem Navigation**: Visualize problem space, connect business context to ML decisions.
*   **Training Data**: Collection methods, constraints, risks.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features, identification logic.
*   **Modeling**: Model choice justification, training process, risk mitigation.
*   **Evaluation & Deployment**: Consistent evaluation techniques, metrics choices.

## Behavioral Interview
Focus on **IMPACT**. Use **STAR** format (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
Signals assessed:
*   **Conflict Resolution**: Resolving disagreements, empathy.
*   **Growing Continuously**: Seeking opportunities, taking criticism.
*   **Embracing Ambiguity**: Operating in changing environments, making decisions with partial info.
*   **Driving Results**: Pushing self/others to deliver goals.
*   **Communicating Effectively**: Tailoring communication to audience.

## General Interview Tips
*   **Explain**: Explain thought process and decision making.
*   **Clarify**: Ask questions to clarify open-ended problems.
*   **Improve**: Start with brute force if needed, then optimize.
*   **Practice**: Write code on paper/whiteboard (no IDE).

## Coding & Algorithm Interviews
*   **Coding**: Know one language deeply (C++, Java, Python, Go, C).
*   **Algorithms**: Sorting, Divide-and-conquer, DP, Recursion. Know Big-O.
*   **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash-maps, Trees, Graphs, Heaps.
*   **Mathematics**: Discrete math, combinatorics (n-choose-k).

## Machine Learning Technical Prep
*   **General Knowledge**: Supervised/unsupervised learning, overfitting, regularization.
*   **Focus Areas**: Recommendation, Computer Vision, NLP, Deep Learning, RL.
*   **Large Scale Design**: Design solutions thinking about data analysis, users, scalability, tradeoffs.

## System Design
1. **Requirement Clarification**: Ask about scale, users, latency, etc.
2. **High-Level Design**: Draw the big picture.
3. **Deep Dive**: Focus on bottlenecks, data models, and API design.
4. **Wrap-up**: Discuss trade-offs and improvements.

## Coding
1. **Understand**: Read carefully, ask questions.
2. **Plan**: Describe approach before coding.
3. **Code**: Write clean, syntactically correct code.
4. **Test**: Walk through with examples/edge cases.
